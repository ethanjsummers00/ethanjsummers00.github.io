## A personal site by and for Ethan Summers
This is a personal site developed starting in 2021 to create an online portfolio for a professional career. This site will contain examples of work created during my timeas a Graphic Information Technology student at Arizona State University. I have created webpages, UX designs, video projects and more.

*This is a work in progress.*
