                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <p>
                    A senior capstone design project, I chose to develop a site for a Battle of the Bands music
                    festival that would take place in Mesa, AZ. I prototyped and coded three responisve pagesfor this site.
                </p>
                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>
                    I developed a general structure for the pages by sketching them out and designing wireframes
                    in Figma, and developing a color and font system meanmt to reflect a punk, rock and roll tone.
                    After taking feedback on the initial designs I developed prototypes that I then developed into an html5 
                    website that displays info about the festival.

                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <p>
                    This project was developed for a Motion Graphics class with the objective of creating an animated
                    mock-up design for a mobile application. For this project I used Adobe Photoshop and After Effects in order
                    to design and animate the graphics. The application envisioned for this project was 'Shedify' an app for the
                    purchase and rental of sheds by the user, which was inspired by applications such as AirBnB and Zillow.
                </p>
                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>
                    First I developed a simple brand identity for 'Shedify', utilizing a pallette of cool greens
                    paired with the iconic Roboto font in a variety of font weights. I developed some basic wireframes
                    in Photoshop before creating a final PS project that I could import and animate into After Effects.

                <p>
                    A Human Systems research study conducted to determine how the dominant color of a webpage effects the perceptions
                    that a user has about a website. Conducted for my Experimental Methods for Human Systems Research course in
                    2021.
                </p>
                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>
                    This study looked to see if the color of a webpage
                    could influence a user's perception of a site. 31 participants were tested by being exposed to one
                    website with one of four dominant colors, and were then asked to rate how well different
                    qualities fit how they felt about the site. I used Amazon MTurk to pull participants and ultimatly
                    was not able to find significant results across the board, but did identify areas for future improvement.

                    I then used existing brand assets and colors to develop a clean brand identity for P.O.D. Marketplace.
