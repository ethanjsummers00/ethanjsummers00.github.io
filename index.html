                        <p>
                            My name is Ethan Summers, I'm <span id="myAge"></span> years old, and I live to be able to create and learn new things.
                            I grew up using computers and consuming the internet culture of the 2000â€™s and coming to love the internet as a platform
                            for creativity. I ended up pursuing the Graphic Information Technology program at ASU to develop a path to making a passion
                            for tech and design a career. Building my experience in HTML5 web development and tools from across the Creative Cloud Suite,
                            I look forward to creating engaging platforms for the web. You can currently find me studying and working as a Community
                            Assistant at ASU's Polytechnic Campus.

                <p>
                    This project was developed for a Motion Graphics class with the objective of creating an animated
                    mock-up design for a mobile application. For this project I used Adobe Photoshop and After Effects in order
                    to design and animate the graphics. The application envisioned for this project was 'Shedify' an app for the
                    purchase and rental of sheds by the user, which was inspired by applications such as AirBnB and Zillow.
                </p>
                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>
                    First I developed a simple brand identity for 'Shedify', utilizing a pallette of cool greens
                    paired with the iconic Roboto font in a variety of font weights. I developed some basic wireframes
                    in Photoshop before creating a final PS project that I could import and animate into After Effects.

                <p>
                    A senior capstone design project, I chose to develop a site for a Battle of the Bands music
                    festival that would take place in Mesa, AZ. I prototyped and coded three responisve pagesfor this site.
                </p>
                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>
                    I developed a general structure for the pages by sketching them out and designing wireframes
                    in Figma, and developing a color and font system meanmt to reflect a punk, rock and roll tone.
                    After taking feedback on the initial designs I developed prototypes that I then developed into an html5 
                    website that displays info about the festival.

                <p>
                    Working off of a previous concept for a site with a checkout feature I developed for a javascript course
                    I first sketched out and created a mockup for a modern shopping website design based off of sites like walmart.com and target.com.
                    I then used existing brand assets and colors to develop a clean brand identity for P.O.D. Marketplace.
